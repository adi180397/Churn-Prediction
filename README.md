# Churn-Prediction
Workflows  
update config.yaml --- we update all the path and direcctory related work  
update schema.yaml --- here we configure the type of columns in the data frame  
update params.yaml --- here we provide the hyperparameters of the model
update the entity ---   
update the configuration manager in src config  
update the components -- here we write the logic of the code(ingestion,validation etc)  
update the pipeline -- make a function to call the stage like ingestion etc  
update the main.py -- here we are a calling the function made in pipeline  
update the app.py  


# About Data sets
1️⃣ Customer Demographics (5 Features)
